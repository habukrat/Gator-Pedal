									<h3>Click on a feature to learn more about its benefits!</h3>
									<br>

									<div>
										<h3 class="feature_title" id="wireless">Wireless</h3>
										<section class="feature_description" id="wireless_description">We provide a wireless interface from the guitar to the pedalboard which allows the player to move around freely. This eliminates the risk of stepping on the cord or getting tangled on other objects. We also provide the ability to use a cord if the player wishes to.<br></section>
									</div>

									<div>
										<h3 class="feature_title" id="multiple">Multiple Mappable Effects</h3>
										<section class="feature_description" id="multiple_description">The Pelican Pedal comes with 5 factory preset effects, and the ability to modify these and add countless more effects. These effects can be mapped to any of the 5 effects buttons. A bank selector is used to switch between 3 banks of effects, allowing the player a total of 15 active effects at any one time.<br></section>
									</div>

									<div>
										<h3 class="feature_title" id="looper">Looper</h3>
										<section class="feature_description" id="looper_description">We provide a built-in looper pedal which allows the player to record up to 1.5 minutes of audio and play that back in a loop.<br></section>
									</div>

									<div>
										<h3 class="feature_title" id="audio">Recording, Saving, and Sharing Audio</h3>
										<section class="feature_description" id="audio_description">With the click of a button, you can begin recording your audio. Once you are finished recording, simply click the stop button and the audio is automatically uploaded to your online Pelican Pedal account for easy access on all devices. You can then share that audio file with friends or other musicians.<br></section>
									</div>

									<div>
										<h3 class="feature_title" id="midi">MIDI Support</h3>
										<section class="feature_description" id="midi_description">This pedal is a fully MIDI capable device and can be used to control your other MIDI devices as well as the pedal. It can be chained with other MIDI devices to allow a MIDI passthrough.<br></section>
									</div>

									<div>
										<h3 class="feature_title" id="tilt">Tilt Effects</h3>
										<section class="feature_description" id="tilt_description">The wireless unit on the guitar also serves to generate custom effects based on the orientation of the guitar. It comes pre-programmed to act as a digital whammy bar, shifting pitches up as you raise the neck of the guitar, and down as you lower it. These effects can be mapped to whichever effect you wish to control, and it is toggled on/off by a button on the pedalboard.<br></section>
									</div>

									<div>
										<h3 class="feature_title" id="share">Sharable User Profiles and Settings</h3>
										<section class="feature_description" id="share_description">Players can save their custom effects configuration to a profile such as “country”, “rock”, etc. This eliminates the need to readjust your settings if changing styles or genres. These profiles are then saved to your online Pelican Pedal account, and can be shared with your friends or the Pelican Pedal community.<br></section>
