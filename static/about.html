									<p id="summary">We noticed a major deficiency in guitar pedals already on the market: they donâ€™t use the internet. So we designed a product that would not only provide the same functionality as expensive pedal boards, but would also allow connectivity to other devices and to the internet. The result is the Pelican Pedal, a multi-function pedalboard capable of producing a wide range of effects, functionality and IOT connectivity.</p>

									<div id="moreStory">
										<p>For decades, electric guitars have remained largely unaffected from the influence of an ever changing technological landscape. Guitarists who want to achieve a unique sound often must purchase hundreds or even thousands of dollars worth of effects pedals and other gear. This becomes burdensome for the working musician, as this gear requires a somewhat lengthy set up and testing process before each gig. Traditional guitar pedals also must be physically adjusted if they player wishes to use the same pedals for different styles of music, causing loss of the previously used settings. And furthermore, this equipment doesn't offer the player a convenient way of recording their sounds.</p>
										<p>Pelican Pedal intends to incorporate technology into this marketplace by utilizing a digital user interface and the Internet of Things to provide a satisfying and convenient solution to these issues. Pelican Pedal is a fully digital pedal board that allows the player to use numerous guitar effects, such as reverb, distortion, pitch shifting, and much more. These effects can be saved to profiles such as Rock, Metal, Country, etc. and allow for effortless transition between genres without any physical alteration of the settings on the pedal itself. This pedal board also has capabilities to record several minutes of audio, with the option of saving an audio file to a remote server, or playing the audio back as a looper pedal.</p>
										<p>In addition to having a built-in LCD showing active effects, this pedal board can also be paired with the Pelican Pedal app, allowing the player to access profile settings and modify them with ease. From this app, players are able to see a comprehensive list of effects and assign effects to different buttons on the pedal board . This app also shows any audio files that were recorded using the Pedal Modeler Pro, and gives the player the option to download the file to whichever device they are using.</p>
										<p>Our pedal board is connected to the guitar using a wireless connection which allows the player to move freely about a stage while performing without worry of tangling or stepping on the cord and it also eliminates the high frequency sound degradation experienced by using longer cords. The wireless transmitter also acts as a proximity detector and can be used to control stage lighting by illuminating the part of the stage where the player is standing.</p>
										<p>Other features of the Pelican Pedal include a built in metronome and tuner with LED indicator lights as well as sensor that measures the orientation of the guitar and can be used for generating custom effects such as a "whammy bar". This sensor is turned on/off on the pedal board as well.</p>
										<p>Pelican Pedal was designed with amateur and semi-professional guitar players in mind but it can also be used by bassists, keyboard players, or even vocalists looking to achieve an innovative new sound.</p>
