                                    <h2 style="text-align: center">Pelican Pedal SWOT</h2>
                                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                                    <li>We offer an inexpensive alternative to the expensive multi-effect pedals.</li>
                                    <li>We are unique in that our product offers features that are not currently available on guitar pedals: built-in metronome and audio recording.</li>
                                    <li>Our product has an advantage in being wireless, allowing the user to have more mobility and interconnectivity with other devices.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                                    <li>Our weakness is not having enough customer feedback. We lack the resource and connections to reach potential customers and get that feedback.</li>
                                    <li>We do not have the same technical or business resources as our established competitors.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                                    <li>A trend right now is that people are getting bigger pedalboards and smaller pedals so that they can fit more pedals. This is an opportunity because it shows that people like to have more effects available to them, which is what our product is going to provide.</li>
                                    <li>Our strengths open doors because we are entering a market that does not have many cheap options. We would be able to reach guitar players who want the versatility of this pedal without having to shell out major cash.</li>
                                    <li>Our product can facilitate convenience as well as utility. </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Threats</h3>
                                    <li>An obstacle would be reaching consumers who are only interested in analog guitar pedals. Guitar players interested in the best sound quality (analog) would rather have many analog pedals than one digital pedal.</li>
                                    <li>Getting users to learn how to use the pedal could be problematic. It would be slightly different than currently existing pedals, and not everyone is willing to learn to use something new when they have something that works for them.</li>
                                    <li>Some users will find setting up the device to be intimidating; they just want to plug it in and play.</li>
                                    <br>

                                    <li>Brand awareness gives them a competitive advantage </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                                    <li>They have higher prices than some competitors</li>
                                    <li>They don’t have wireless capabilities</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                                    <li>Their products are modular and play well with each other and other products players might already have</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Threats</h3>
                                    <li>Pricing is high and is a barrier to some customers</li>
                                    <br>

								<h2 style="text-align: center">Boss SWOT</h2>
                                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                                    <li>One of Boss’s largest strength is the sound quality of its products.</li>
                                    <li>Another one of Boss’s strengths is intuitive feel of their products because of their friendly user interface.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                                    <li>A weakness would be that most of their products are on the expensive side.</li>
                                    <li>Another weakness is that their guitar pedals are not wireless.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                                    <li>Boss has one of the largest guitar pedal market shares at 30%. This is an opportunity to continue expanding because the company has already built customer loyalty.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Threats</h3>
                                    <li>Possible obstacles would be losing sales due to pricing.</li>
